        Not all treasures are meant to be found. Some whisper from the shadows,
        waiting for the right hands to claim them.

        The Unseen Market is where such artifacts resurface—rings of power,
        relics of forgotten ages, objects imbued with stories best left untold.
        Their pasts are unknown, their powers uncertain. Some seek them for
        their beauty, others for the influence they might grant. But all who
        take from the Market must accept the unseen cost.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The Market does not ask for names. It does not care for intentions.
        Those who come seeking are welcome, but they do not always leave
        unchanged. Some objects carry memories, echoes of those who held them
        before. Others demand more than gold.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
        There are no guarantees, no promises. What is here today may be gone
        tomorrow. What you claim may slip from your grasp—or refuse to let go.
        The Market exists in the spaces between, shifting and elusive, waiting
        for those who dare to enter.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
        No questions asked. No names given. Choose wisely—what you take from the
        Market may take something from you in return.
